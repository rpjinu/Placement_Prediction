## Overview
The Placement Prediction Project is a machine learning application designed to predict the placement outcomes of students based on various input features such as IQ, CGPA, communication skills, technical skills, extracurricular activities, internship experience, and leadership skills. The project uses a trained model to provide insights into students' likelihood of getting placed in a company.

## Features
- **Input Features:**
  - IQ
  - CGPA
  - Communication Skills
  - Technical Skills
  - Extracurricular Activities
  - Internship Experience
  - Leadership Skills
- **Output:**
  - Placement outcome (1 for placed, 0 for not placed)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/placement-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd placement-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Open the provided URL in your web browser.
3. Enter the required input features in the application interface.
4. View the predicted placement outcome.

## Model
The project uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a dataset containing features related to student performance and activities. The model predicts whether a student will be placed based on the provided inputs.

## File Structure
- `app.py`: Streamlit application script.
- `model.pkl`: Saved machine learning model.
